Α. ξ ι. Cicero' s acquaintance with the Scaevolae. ξ 2.
Scaevola, the augur, happened to speak one day os a notos-iou
quarrel between two quondam friends, P. Sulpicius Rufus and
Q. Pompeius. [Suipicius was originally on the aristocratic side,
but being plebeian tribune in 88 Rc„ he became a tool of Manius
and proposed some revolutionary laws. His former friend
Pompeius was consui, and vigorously opposed him. ln ι sight,
the son os Pompeius was slain; aster which Sulla entered the
city with an army and Sulpicius was killed] ἦ 3. This led
Scaevola to report a conversation concerning sriendship which
Laelius had held with his two sons·in·law, Scaevola himself and
Fannius. This conversation Cicero has sreeiy rendered. ς 4.
The work is done at the request of Atticus, and is now presented
to him, as the Cato maior had been. Cato vas the most
suitable Roman to speak of old ageg and Laetius, whose intimacy
with Scipio was far-samed, to speak os sriendship. ξ ς. 'nze
