editors in the future must continue to build. 1
have compared also my own notes throughout
with those contained in the editions by Nauck and
Lahmeyer. These editions have proved not nearly
so usesul as I expected from their very extensive
circulation in Germany. My debts to them are
acknowledgcd, each in its proper place, as are also my
obligations to Nagclsbach and other writers on the
Latin os Cicero. It may be well sor me to state that
1 have no acquaintance with any English edition os
the Laelius. 1 only heard os Mr Arthur Sidgwick·s
edition as forthcoming at a time when my own was
sar advanced.

1 expect to have finished by Easter next my
edition os the Cato maior (De Senectute). At that
point my series os editions os Cicero's works must
stop for a time, though 1 hope to add to it in future
years.
