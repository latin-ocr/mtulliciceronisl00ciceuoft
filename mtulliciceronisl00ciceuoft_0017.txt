-· udor· So the uss give to the Brutus (thus called by Cicero
Α in De dc'vinasione 2, 3) the second title De claris oratoribus.

Such dwble titles were not uncommon. They are frequently
found in ancient citations of Plato’s works and in uss; e.g.

, OQ περὶ faraoni>- Varro also wrote a great number of
““ boob (called libn'logyssrtorrki) which took their first titles from

. the namet of persons, their second titles from their subject-
Ψ manerl. We may fairly conclude then that the proper com·
’ plote title of our dialogue is Laelius de amicitia.

in the general account of Cicero's philosophical works. lt is
cle-r from De divinatione 2, 3 that when that work appeared,
the Laetam had not yet been written, while the Cato maior had

mentioned in the passage of De divinatione above referred to)
there is a reference to the Laelius. ‘rhe Cato maior was writ-
ten in the spring of ⁴4 B.c. soon after Caesar’s death, and the
De oficiis was completed in November of the same year¹. As

and October were occupied by the De officiis, and probably
April and May by the De divinatione, we shall not greatly err
