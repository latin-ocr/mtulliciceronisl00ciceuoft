he closed his days in a blaze os glory. ξιξ ι3-ις, In spite of
new-sangled philosophies‚ 1 believe, with our forefathers and
with Socrates, that the soul lives aster death. Scipio believed so
too, and as though he felt death coming, treated of the matter at
the end os a three days’ discourse on the best form of govern-
ment, which he held a few days before he died. He then recited
a communication he had received in a dream from the elder
Africanus. [The Somnium Scipionis formed the greater part of
the vlth book of cicero‘s work De re publica, and has come
down to us entire. Early in this century Cardinal Mai dis·
covered a manuscript containing considerable portions of the
remainder os the work. Cicero intended the book to give a
pictme of the ideal statesman in the person os Scipio.] Even if
death extinguishes the soul, it does no harm. It is therefore
vell with Scipio, however it be· My lise has been happy because
1 lived it with Scipio, and 1 care more sor the memory os our
stiendship to remain sor all time, than 1 do sor my name saptens
to which 1 have no just claim!
