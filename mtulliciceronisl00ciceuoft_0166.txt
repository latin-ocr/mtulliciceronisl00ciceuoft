(1879) 1 have read two pam mets bearing on the Greek m of
the Laelius. The first is by taxator. entitled ‘Qu-‘d in mmm

of which ate quoted in my notes. But he neglectu to notice the gre-t
divergenoe between the two trentises in subject-matt« aad tempat-

should have had striking ooroespondenoe in the treatment of the theme.
Altogether antor does not much advance the problem tow-nb ι

the pamphlet contains perhaps more misprints than m ever befoee
