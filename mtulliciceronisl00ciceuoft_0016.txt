Laelius, who as a distinguished Roman general and mmo·
man, could not be allowed to go too dceply into philosophi·
cal questions. Besides this imitation os Theophrastua,one or
two direct imitations occur of a discourse os Socrates on
friendship recorded by Xenophon in his Memorabilia (2, 4-1o)¹.
further, there is a slight reference in the prooemium ω the
Theaetetus os Plato). Beyond this ιιο distinet adaptationi ps
Greek originals can be traced lt is extremely doubtful, or
perhaps more than doubtful, whether Cicero used in this natine
the 13‘12-0mac11ean Etluks, though he knew of its existence⁸, and
had perhaps, at some time, read it. Several resemblance· be·
tween that work and portions of the Laelius can be accounted
for by the fact that many os Aristotle’s ethical utteranees had
passed into commonplaces. lt is exceedingly likelythat Cion-o
knew Plato’s Lysis, but 1 am unable to point out any distinct
imitation of it θ. No doubt Cicero read and used bere and there
other Greek treatises on Friendship, which we do not nov
possess. ln ξ 45 Cicero adapts some lines of Euripide· which
Plutarch says were commented on by Chrysippus in hia work
πσρὶ φιλίας, but the verses were so notorious that there is no
reason to suspect imitation.

b. The title. The main title is put beyond doubt by Cioem't
own words in the De officit} 2, 3¹ sed de amittis «eo lt'bm
dictum est qui inscrib itur Laelius& There are rumbo&-
ενοι, sor supposing that the author intended it abo tobetrthe
secondary title De amcitiam· see the passage in Laeuus ς ut
